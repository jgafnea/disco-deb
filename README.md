## Journal

I chose Python because it's normally what I use once tasks become too much for shell scripts.

I started by breaking the project down into three functions, each performing one of the tasks described in the instructions: fetching, parsing, and output.

For fetching, I used `requests` because it generally makes HTTP things easier. Work is currently done in memory and works well given the small file sizes, but would need to be updated for significantly larger files.

For parsing, I used a series of splits (`splitlines`, `rsplit`, and `split`) to break the contents down into lines and then into collections of files and associated packages.

For counting, I used `Counter` because it performs as well as a hash table but it's easier to use and read, especially coming back to it months later.

For printing, I used `most_common` to get the top 10 packages (optionally accepting a different number) and `enumerate` to loop through and print each one. I added a utility function using running maximums and used those values with f-strings to print results with columns aligned.

For parsing arguments, I used `argparse` because it handles basic validation and shows accepted arguments on usage. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.

For main functionality, I wrapped everything in a `main()` function and called it at the end.

For testing, I used `pytest` to mock the `Contents` file structure and shorten the dev/test cycle. I admittedly didn't do any written tests for networking, mainly because the debian repo, in my experience, is rather stable, so I instead focused on the issues I actually had, namely the parsing and counting.

Two things that were prob "harder" than they should be:

1. Mentally parsing lines like the following:

```
bin/file libdevel/packageA,libdevel/packageB
```

For whatever reason I kept thinking backwards and getting numbers wrong. Writing out the parsing logic and adding variables made the format easier to follow.

2. Naming things when there's ambiguity, like [in the fetching function](./assets/contents.png). What I normally do is renaming something like `contents_` to essentially point out that _this_ is the important thing, and in this example, that meant the thing being returned. I'm not sure if this is a good practice, but it's something I picked up somewhere along the way.

This documentation was, by far, the hardest part of the project. I'm okay with code, testing, and documentation in general, but framing my thoughts explicitly was new and I'm especially terrified of doing it all "wrong." I tried to "think out loud" and translate that into written form, I hope the result conveys the what and why effectively. ü§ûüôè

Total time was 6 hours.
