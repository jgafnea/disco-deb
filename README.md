## Journal

I chose Python because it's normally what I use once tasks become too much for shell scripts.

I started by breaking the project down into three functions, each performing one of the tasks described in the instructions: fetching, parsing, and output.

For fetching, I used `requests` because it generally makes HTTP things easier. Work is currently done in memory and works well given the small file sizes, but would need to be updated for significantly larger files.

For parsing, I used a series of splits (`splitlines`, `rsplit`, and `split`) to break the contents down into lines and then into collections of files and associated packages.

For counting, I used `Counter` because it performs as well as a hash table but it's easier to use and read, especially coming back to it months later.

For printing, I used `most_common` to get the top 10 packages (optionally accepting a different number) and `enumerate` to loop through and print each one. I added a utility function using running maximums and used those values with f-strings to print results with columns aligned.

For parsing arguments, I used `argparse` because it handles basic validation and shows accepted arguments on usage. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.

For main functionality, I wrapped everything in a `main()` function and called it at the end.

For testing, I used `pytest` to mock the `Contents` structure, which helped shorten the dev/test cycle. I didn't write tests for networking, as in my experience, the Debian repo is fairly stable, so I didn't want to write tests just for sake of coverage. I focused on the areas I had issues, namely the parsing and counting.

For testing, I used `pytest` to mock the `Contents` structure, which helped speed up the development and test cycle. I didn't write tests for networking, as the Debian repo IME is generally stable, so I didn't want to add tests just for coverage. Instead, I focused on the areas where I encountered issues, specifically parsing and counting.

Total time: ~~6~~ 7 hours.

## Obstacles

Things that were harder than they prob should have been:

#### Mentally parsing items
   
```
bin/file libdevel/packageA,libdevel/packageB
```
For whatever reason I kept getting files and packages backwards and ending up with wrong totals. Writing out the parsing logic and adding variables made the format much easier to follow.

#### Naming things

This is especially hard when there's ambiguity, like [in the fetching function](./assets/contents.png). Normally I'll rename something like `contents_` to point out that _this_ is the key element, and in this case, that meant the value being returned. I don't know if that's a good or bad practice, but it's something I picked up somewhere.

#### Documentation

This documentation was, by far, the hardest part of the project. I'm okay with code, testing, and documentation in general, but framing my thoughts explicitly was new and I'm especially terrified of doing it all "wrong." I tried to "think out loud" and translate that into written form, I hope the result conveys the what and why effectively. ü§ûüôè
